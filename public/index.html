      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

      You've stumbled upon the beginning of an elaborate rabbit hole. Nice!
      At the end of this quest lies a treasure trove of real nice content
      and access to an inner circle of fellow real nice brethren. You'll find
      videos that you can't unsee. You'll hear tracks from the boys that
      you would think should be sound crimes. This is not a social networking
      website, it's a diverse collective of real nice people who like
      Real Nice songs. Good luck and if you need help ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
      
      If you want our hot uploads
      You'll have to crack our real nice codes
      I've listed below the address to start
      It's fully encrypted so I hope you're smart
      The pad you need repeatsandrepeatsandrepeatsandrepeats
      It's the initials of the authors who compose these beats
