And did I say that I really had a great time? You got a real nice place, really like your style I got a brick of Blue Ribbon can I stay awhile? You got a real nice bathroom, I could sleep in the tub I'll leave a really sweet note to express my love You got a real nice place, think I made it clear I could really picture chilin' on your couch for years You've got a well stocked fridge, really like your taste Well I'm so happy that we met You got a real nice place Roller coaster of emotion *Roller coaster of emotion* Layin' on lawns Lightin' up loud Playin' croquet Lazy make outs I hope I can keep this with me They say that time it always flies One day you're here, one day you die So we should swap some spit by the sea OoOoOh so slow Summer in slow-mo Let me orbit your galaxy I love the sun but I can barely see Never gonna stop *Never gonna stop* Droppin' hints that I love you *Never gonna stop* Cuz that's a thing you don't rush into *Never gonna stop* Keepin' cool when we're chillin' *Never gonna stop* Holdin' onto this feeling Don't you wanna live by the sea?

Take care of me I don't want you to feel left behind You're not alone I'm on your side I woke up fightin' for your place in line Naw babe it's fine that I'm losin' mine Take care of me Somewhere a flower's got some pollen with my name on it You know I ain't comin' home til my basket's full Every little grain will tilt the scale in favor of the family *get honey get honey get honey get honey get honey* If we can survive We'll build a better beehive Leave all this honey behind For our descendants to reap *sweet honey sweet honey sweet honey sweet honey sweet honey sweet* With all the spiders and the frogs and the lizards and the birds I hope a bear don't find our home Home is where my baby buzzer and my honey money wait for me Are you still my queen if I bumble this? Ya the rain may fall and the wind may whip I will do my best to provide for the hive Life is fragile we gotta stay alive You're the type of bee I could wax poetic for Straighten out my fur with a fine tooth honeycomb Snuggled up tight in the six sides Feed 'em that Royal Jelly *royal jelly royal jelly royal* Every little step in my dance is a metaphor Sticky little heaven is sure worth stingin' for I'm prepared to kamikaze Rip my heart from my body Are you still my queen if I bumble this? Ya the rain may fall and the wind may whip I will do my best to provide for the hive Life is fragile we gotta stay alive I am a walking chemical caption I come from a long line of over reactions Oh no we're molecules Oh no we're animals I might have smoked too many joints before I came out partyin' tonight I like the way it feels like the old days And I like steppin' out of my old ways I'm about to break out... *walkin' fast and now I'm walkin' fast* I need a breath, take a break from the party Do me a favor if you see my baby Tell her move quick down here like the water runs Tell her I am keepin' calm and cool down here I like the way it feels like the old days And I like steppin' out of my old ways I'm about to break out... God damn it's been a long day Think that I should kick my feet up I've been spreading myself too thin I'm not answering the phone, checkin' my texts Turnin' off the light and my TV set God damn it's been a long day Think that I should grab a bottle of wine I slip in the nerves wash clean away Light some candles, feel the love Put some bubbles in the tub I'm gonna read a million books Think of songs with killer hooks ...like this one It's my bath time It's the right time Oh god they talk so loud Ain't nobody wanna be left out If I can't get some peace then I'm gonna lose my head Think that I should take a bath instead ...set's me right When you can't take another day like that Head's flippin' round playin' acrobat Get a hot track with that ratatat-tat from the hi-hat In your eardrums, through your headphones Pulsin' through your backbone ...so good inside It's my bath time It's the right time It's a god damn shame that it took this long It was weird, it was strange, but hey It's kinda all I've ever known Is it coincidence babe? Is it the fate of our souls? That we share a life beneath the sun And laugh at everything we're sold 10,000 lights in your mouth *wanna see your teeth, wanna see your teeth* Sure our lives may seem A-typical But each and every single one of us Are tryin' to reach the same results As ancient as the pyramids As fresh as apathetic bliss As hot as global warming is, that's what you are What you are to me I would like to make you smile 10,000 lights in your mouth *wanna see your teeth, wanna see your teeth* *I would like to make you smile* I wanna get a dog with you, baby I wanna get a fish or two, maybe If you want to... I won't pressure you... I like chilly days They're good walkin' Turn up at your door And baby these dogs are barkin' This year went so fast *It's amazin' how we're changin'* I'd never take it back I want to talk to you about somethin' All in all in all it's all good I wanna get a dog with you, baby I wanna get a fish or two, maybe If you want to... I won't pressure you... Give a little, get a little ok Get up and fuck up the new day Give a little, give it up ok Get up and fuck up the new day Give a little, get a little ok Get up and get back the new day Give a little, get a little ok Get up and get back the new day now I want to talk to you about somethin' All in all in all it's all good *I wanna talk to you* I wanna get a dog with you, baby I wanna get a fish or two, maybe If you want to... I won't pressure you... *I wanna talk to you* I've been hearin' some spooky things The floors are creakin' they creep me the fuck out Are they speakin' to me? The doors and windows are shuttin' themselves I went to work they rearranged my shelves I'm tired of losing things Is there a stranger? Am I crazy? Or is there something lurkin' in the wings? Some phenomenal thing pullin' the strings? Should we get a shaman or a rabbi or a priest? Should we buy a ouija board? Or try to exorcise the beast with fire? But I don't want to hurt them if they're cool... *what a good day to be alive* You only get one life in a lifetime You only get one first chance the first time *I hope that I could make your day* *If I could maybe then you'd stay* Thank god I'm alive You're either with me or I'm without you Don't get to spooky and we can talk this through I'll roll a fat one, we'll get a buzz on Tell me how you died, I'll make some bad ghost puns Sometimes I feel like a robot short circuited cuz I'm so scared of you When I wake and you're next to me at night Lemme ask some questions, maybe you can set me right Can you get a hold of Buddha, can you summon Jesus Christ? I've been havin' some anxieties about the afterlife Am I doomed to haunt the halls with you if this is where I die? Thank god I'm alive *what a good day to be alive* Who's got a lighter in the front seat? I've got a lighter in the front seat Pass it to the backseat! Who's got a lighter in the back seat?
